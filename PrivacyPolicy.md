The Application does not require any user registration and does not require the user to provide any personal information.
The User Provided Data is the information you provide directly within the Application.

## 1.2 Automatically Collected Information

The Application itself does not collect any personal information. However, it utilizes the NextTrace API (hosted at nxtrace.org) which is not managed by the developer of the Application. The NextTrace API collects IP addresses related to you, your target request, and all intermediate traceroute hops. It also infers and collects your approximate location based on these IP addresses. This information is gathered by The NextTrace API for the essential functionality of route tracing and analysis. If you do not consent to the collection of your personal information by the NextTrace API, you may change the API's domain name in the settings page before using the application. Please be advised that we do not guarantee the performance or reliability of any third-party API domains that you configure. Additionally, the basic functionality of the Application involves querying third-party DNS servers with the domain name information you provide and that is specified on the settings page. These DNS servers are not managed by the developers of the Application and may collect your IP address and DNS query records. If you do not consent to these DNS servers collecting your personal information, you may change the DNS server address in the settings page before using the Application. Please be advised that we do not guarantee the performance or reliability of any third-party DNS servers that you configure.

# 2. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
The Application is free software, and we do not derive any income from it. The Application itself does not share or sell any data to third parties. However, the basic functionality of the Application requires the use of third-party APIs and tools, as detailed in Chapter 1 'COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION'.
